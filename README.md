A Node.js app that colorizes the ls output with color and icons. Here are the screenshots of working example on an iTerm2 terminal (Mac OS), `oh-my-zsh` with `spacehip` theme and `powerline nerd-font + awesome-config` font with the `Ayu dark` color theme.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js (preferably, version > 4.0.0)

2. Install the patched fonts of powerline nerd-font and/or font-awesome. Have a look at the [Nerd Font README](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/readme.md) for more installation instructions.

    *Note for iTerm2 users - Please enable the Nerd Font at iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Text > Non-ASCII font > Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.*

3. Install the colorls app with `npm install -g @husnulanwari/colorls`

4. Start using colorls ðŸŽ‰

5. Have a look at Recommended configurations and Custom configurations.

## Recommended configurations

1. To add some short command (say, `lc`), add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) :

    ```
    alias lc='colorls'
    alias ll='colorls -- -lAst'
    ```

    You can find options usage in [custom configurations](#custom-configurations) section.

## Custom configurations

- With `--help` : Prints not so very helpful help menu (updated soon)

- With `--sort` (default): Sort output to show directory first. Use `--no-sort` to show `ls` output as is :

- With `ls` flags. You can use `ls` flags, just put it after `--`, something like `ls --sort -- -lAst . ./pictures`
